Only works in Chrome. Don't ask why.

To open in Chrome (if Chrome isn't default browser): Download file, right click on file, click "unzip contents", open file, then find "index". Right click on "index" and choose "open with" then "google chrome". Sadly, that's the only way it works.
To open in Chrome (if Chrome is default browser): Download file, open to "index", open "index".

This is why Chrome should be your default browser.
